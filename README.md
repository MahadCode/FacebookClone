I'm excited to showcase my latest creation, which is an HTML and CSS-only Facebook clone! 🌐
This project was a fantastic method for me to put my web programming talents to use and hone my comprehension of responsive design.

Important characteristics consist of:
A clean layout that resembles the Facebook user interface.
Interactive Elements such as links, buttons, etc

Through this project, I was able to learn more about front-end development and hone my abilities to build cutting-edge, user-friendly websites. eager to add additional features to it in the future!
